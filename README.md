_"Get out the rye bread and [mlustard](https://github.com/hora/mlustard),
Grandma, it is **grand slalami** time!"_

Notdave Niehaus

**grand-slalami** takes ~~some rye bread~~
[Blaseball](https://www.blaseball.com/) game event data,
optionally enhanced with [mlustard](https://github.com/hora/mlustard),
and returns a comment for a game update.
There is a plan for implementing different levels of commenting (for example,
different levels of colour commentary).
Currently, this returns a minimal amount of enhanced commentary to make it
possible to follow a Blaseball game by audio only.
See [/lib/quips](lib/quips) for when comments will be enhanced.
